Values are returned from function by using the optional return statement.

Any type may be returned, including arrays and objects.

This causes the function to end its execution immediately and pass control back to the line from which it was called.

If the return is omitted the value null will be returned.

Use of return

Copy
<?php
function square($num)
{
    return $num * $num;
}
echo square(4);   // outputs '16'.
?>



A function can not return multiple values, but similar results can be obtained by returning an array.

Returning an array to get multiple values

Copy
<?php
function small_numbers()
{
    return array (0, 1, 2);
}
list ($zero, $one, $two) = small_numbers();
?>


To return a reference from a function, use the reference operator & in both the function declaration and when assigning the returned value to a variable:

Returning a reference from a function

Copy
<?php
function &returns_reference()
{
    return $someref;
}

$newref =& returns_reference();
?>
