PHP basic arithmetic operators are listed here:

Example	Name	Result
+$a	Identity	Conversion of $a to int or float as appropriate.
-$a	Negation	Opposite of $a.
$a + $b	Addition	Sum of $a and $b.
$a - $b	Subtraction	Difference of $a and $b.
$a * $b	Multiplication	Product of $a and $b.
$a / $b	Division	Quotient of $a and $b.
$a % $b	Modulo	Remainder of $a divided by $b.
$a ** $b	Exponentiation	Result of raising $a to the $b'th power.
The division operator ("/") returns a float value unless the two operands are integers.

For integer division, see intdiv().

Operands of modulo are converted to integers by stripping the decimal part before processing.

For floating-point modulo, see fmod().

The result of the modulo operator % has the same sign as the dividend - that is, the result of $a % $b will have the same sign as $a.

For example:

Copy
<?php

echo (5 % 3)."\n";           // prints 2
echo (5 % -3)."\n";          // prints 2
echo (-5 % 3)."\n";          // prints -2
echo (-5 % -3)."\n";         // prints -2

?>
