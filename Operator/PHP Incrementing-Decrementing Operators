PHP supports C-style pre- and post-increment and decrement operators.

variable++ and variable-- are increment and decrement operators.

In PHP, like in C, there are two types of increment - pre-increment and post-increment.

Both pre-increment and post-increment essentially increment the variable, and the effect on the variable is identical.

The difference is with the value of the increment expression.

Pre-increment, which is written '++$variable', evaluates to the incremented value.

PHP increments the variable before reading its value, thus the name 'pre-increment'.

Post-increment, which is written '$variable++' evaluates to the original value of $variable, before it was incremented.

PHP increments the variable after reading its value, thus the name 'post-increment'.

The following example should help you understand pre- and post-increment and expressions in general a bit better:

Copy
<?php
function double($i)
{
    return $i*2;
}
$b = $a = 5;        /* assign the value five into the variable $a and $b */
print($a);
print($b);
$c = $a++;          /* post-increment, assign original value of $a
                       (5) to $c */
$e = $d = ++$b;     /* pre-increment, assign the incremented value of
                       $b (6) to $d and $e */

print($c);
print($d);
print($e);


/* at this point, both $d and $e are equal to 6 */

$f = double($d++);  /* assign twice the value of $d before
                       the increment, 2*6 = 12 to $f */
$g = double(++$e);  /* assign twice the value of $e after
                       the increment, 2*7 = 14 to $g */
$h = $g += 10;      /* first, $g is incremented by 10 and ends with the
                       value of 24. the value of the assignment (24) is
                       then assigned into $h, and $h ends with the value
                       of 24 as well. */

print($f);
print($g);
print($h);

?>
Result


The increment/decrement operators only affect numbers and strings.

Arrays, objects, booleans and resources are not affected.

Decrementing null values has no effect too, but incrementing them results in 1.

Example	Name	Effect
++$a	Pre-increment	Increments $a by one, then returns $a.
$a++	Post-increment	Returns $a, then increments $a by one.
--$a	Pre-decrement	Decrements $a by one, then returns $a.
$a--	Post-decrement	Returns $a, then decrements $a by one.
Here's a simple example script:

Copy
<?php
echo "Postincrement\n";
$a = 5;
echo "Should be 5: " . $a++ . "\n\n";
echo "Should be 6: " . $a . "\n\n";

echo "Preincrement\n";
$a = 5;
echo "Should be 6: " . ++$a . "\n\n";
echo "Should be 6: " . $a . "\n\n";

echo "Postdecrement\n";
$a = 5;
echo "Should be 5: " . $a-- . "\n\n";
echo "Should be 4: " . $a . "\n\n";

echo "Predecrement\n";
$a = 5;
echo "Should be 4: " . --$a . "\n\n";
echo "Should be 4: " . $a . "\n\n";
?>
