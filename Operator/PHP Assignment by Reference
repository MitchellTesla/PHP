Assignment by reference is supported by PHP, using the syntax as:

Copy
$var = &$other_var;
Assignment by reference means that both variables end up pointing at the same data, and nothing is copied anywhere.

Assigning by reference

Copy
<?php
$a = 3;
$b = &$a; // $b is a reference to $a

print "$a\n"; // prints 3
print "$b\n"; // prints 3

$a = 4; // change $a

print "$a\n"; // prints 4
print "$b\n"; // prints 4 as well, since $b is a reference to $a, which has
              // been changed
?>
