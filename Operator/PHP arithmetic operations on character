In PHP

Copy
$a = 'Z'; 
$a++;
turns $a into 'AA'.

Note that character variables can be incremented but not decremented and even so only plain ASCII alphabets and digits (a-z, A-Z and 0-9) are supported.

Incrementing/decrementing other character variables has no effect, the original string is unchanged.

Arithmetic Operations on Character Variables

Copy
<?php
echo '== Alphabets ==' . PHP_EOL;
$s = 'W';
for ($n=0; $n<6; $n++) {
    echo ++$s . PHP_EOL;
}
// Digit characters behave differently
echo '== Digits ==' . PHP_EOL;
$d = 'A8';
for ($n=0; $n<6; $n++) {
    echo ++$d . PHP_EOL;
}
$d = 'A08';
for ($n=0; $n<6; $n++) {
    echo ++$d . PHP_EOL;
}
?>
Result


Incrementing or decrementing booleans has no effect.
