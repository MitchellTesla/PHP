The basic assignment operator is "=".

It really means that the left operand gets set to the value of the expression on the right.

The value of an assignment expression is the value assigned.

That is, the value of "$a = 3" is 3.

This allows you to do some tricky things:

Copy
<?php

$a = ($b = 4) + 5; // $a is equal to 9 now, and $b has been set to 4.
print($a);
?>
