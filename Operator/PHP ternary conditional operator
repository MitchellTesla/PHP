The ternary conditional operator:

Copy
<?php
$first ? $second : $third
?>
If the value of the first subexpression is true (non-zero), then the second subexpression is evaluated, and that is the result of the conditional expression.

Otherwise, the third subexpression is evaluated, and that is the value.

Assigning a default value

Copy
<?php
// Example usage for: Ternary Operator
$action = (empty($_POST['action'])) ? 'default' : $_POST['action'];

// The above is identical to this if/else statement
if (empty($_POST['action'])) {
    $action = 'default';
} else {
    $action = $_POST['action'];
}

?>
It is possible to leave out the middle part of the ternary operator.

Expression expr1 ?: expr3 returns expr1 if expr1 evaluates to true, and expr3 otherwise.

The ternary operator is an expression, and that it doesn't evaluate to a variable, but to the result of an expression
