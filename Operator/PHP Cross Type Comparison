For various types, comparison is done according to the following table (in order).

Type of Operand 1
Type of Operand 2
Result
null or string
string
Convert null to "", numerical or lexical comparison
bool or null
anything
Convert both sides to bool, false < true
object
object
Built-in classes can define its own comparison, different classes are uncomparable, same class see Object Comparison
string,
resource,
int or
float
string,
resource,
int or
float
Translate strings and resources to numbers, usual math



array
array
Array with fewer members is smaller, if key from operand 1 is not found in operand 2 then arrays are uncomparable, otherwise - compare value by value (see following example)
object
anything
object is always greater
array
anything
array is always greater
Boolean/null comparison

Copy
<?php
// Bool and null are compared as bool always
var_dump(1 == TRUE);  // TRUE - same as (bool)1 == TRUE
var_dump(0 == FALSE); // TRUE - same as (bool)0 == FALSE
var_dump(100 < TRUE); // FALSE - same as (bool)100 < TRUE
var_dump(-10 < FALSE);// FALSE - same as (bool)-10 < FALSE
// NULL - (bool)NULL < (bool)-100 is FALSE < TRUE
var_dump(min(-100, -10, NULL, 10, 100));
