PHP supports one error control operator: the at sign (@).

When prepended to an expression in PHP, any error messages that might be generated by that expression will be ignored.

If you have set a custom error handler function with set_error_handler() then it will still get called, but this custom error handler can and should call error_reporting() which will return 0.

Any error message generated by the expression is available in the "message" element of the array returned by error_get_last().

The result of that function will change on each error, so it needs to be checked early.

Copy
<?php
/* Intentional file error */
$my_file = @file ('non_existent_file') or
    die ("Failed opening file: error was '" . 
                error_get_last()['message'] . "'");
?>
@ works for any expression, not just functions:

will not issue a notice if the index $key doesn't exist.

Copy
<?php
$value = @$cache[$key];
?>
Note: The @-operator works only on expressions
