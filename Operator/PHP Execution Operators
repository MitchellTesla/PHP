PHP supports one execution operator: backticks (``).

Note that these are not single-quotes!

PHP will attempt to execute the contents of the backticks as a shell command;

the output will be returned.

Use of the backtick operator is identical to shell_exec().

Copy
<?php
$output = `dir`;//`ls -al`;
echo $output;
?>
Result


The backtick operator is disabled when shell_exec() is disabled.

Unlike some other languages, backticks have no special meaning within double-quoted strings.
