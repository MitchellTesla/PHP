There are two string operators.

The first is the concatenation operator ('.'), which returns the concatenation of its right and left arguments.

The second is the concatenating assignment operator ('.='), which appends the argument on the right side to the argument on the left side.

Copy
<?php
$a = "Hello ";
$b = $a . "World!"; // now $b contains "Hello World!"
print_r($b);

$a = "Hello ";

$a .= "World!";     // now $a contains "Hello World!"
print_r($b);
?>
