When a string is specified in double quotes or with heredoc, variables are parsed within it.

There are two types of syntax: a simple one and a complex one.

The simple syntax provides a way to embed a variable, an array value, or an object property in a string with a minimum of effort.

The complex syntax can be recognised by the curly braces surrounding the expression.

Simple syntax
If a dollar sign ($) is encountered, the parser will greedily take as many tokens as possible to form a valid variable name.

Enclose the variable name in curly braces to explicitly specify the end of the name.

Copy
<?php
$juice = "orange";

echo "He drank some $juice juice." . PHP_EOL;
// Invalid. "s" is a valid character for a variable name,
// but the variable is $juice.
echo "He drank some juice made of $juices.";
// Valid. Explicitly specify the end of the variable name 
// by enclosing it in braces:
echo "He drank some juice made of ${juice}s.";
?>
