Some numeric operations can result in a value represented by the constant NAN.

This result represents an undefined or unrepresentable value in floating-point calculations.

Any loose or strict comparisons of this value against any other value, including itself, but except true, will have a result of false.

Because NAN represents any number of different values, NAN should not be compared to other values, including itself, and instead should be checked for using is_nan()
