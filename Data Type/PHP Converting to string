A value can be converted to a string using the (string) cast or the strval() function.

String conversion is automatically done in the scope of an expression where a string is needed.

This happens when using the echo or print functions, or when a variable is compared to a string.

Bool
A bool true value is converted to the string "1". bool false is converted to "" (the empty string). This allows conversion back and forth between bool and string values.

Number
An int or float is converted to a string representing the number textually (including the exponent part for floats).

Floating point numbers can be converted using exponential notation (4.1E+6).

Array
Arrays are always converted to the string "Array".

Because of this, echo and print can not by themselves show the contents of an array.

To view a single element, use a construction such as echo $arr['foo'].

print_r() and var_dump() for more effective means of inspecting the contents of array and object types.

Object
In order to convert objects to string magic method __toString must be used.

null is always converted to an empty string.
