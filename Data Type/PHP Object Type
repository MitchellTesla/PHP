Object Initialization
To create a new object, use the new statement to instantiate a class:

Copy
<?php
class foo
{
    function do_foo()
    {
        echo "Doing foo.";
    }
}

$bar = new foo;
$bar->do_foo();
?>



Converting to object
If an object is converted to an object, it is not modified.

If a value of any other type is converted to an object, a new instance of the stdClass built-in class is created.

If the value was null, the new instance will be empty.

An array converts to an object with properties named by keys and corresponding values.

Copy
<?php
$obj = (object) array('1' => 'foo');
var_dump(isset($obj->{'1'})); 
// outputs 'bool(true)' as of PHP 7.2.0; 'bool(false)' previously
var_dump(key($obj)); 
// outputs 'string(1) "1"' as of PHP 7.2.0; 'int(1)' previously
?>
Result


For any other value, a member variable named scalar will contain the value.

Copy
<?php
$obj = (object) 'test';
echo $obj->scalar;  
?>
