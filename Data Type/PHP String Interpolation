An array index or an object property can be parsed.

With array indices, the closing square bracket (]) marks the end of the index.

The same rules apply to object properties as to simple variables.

Copy
<?php
$juices = array("apple", "orange", "myKey" => "purple");

echo "He drank some $juices[0] juice.".PHP_EOL;
echo "He drank some $juices[1] juice.".PHP_EOL;
echo "He drank some $juices[myKey] juice.".PHP_EOL;
?>
Result


Copy
<?php
class people {
    public $john = "John";
    public $jane = "Jane";
    public $robert = "Robert";
    public $smith = "Smith";
}

$people = new people();

echo "$people->john drank some $juices[0] juice.".PHP_EOL;
echo "$people->john then said hello to $people->jane.".PHP_EOL;
echo "$people->john's wife greeted $people->robert.".PHP_EOL;
echo "$people->robert greeted the two $people->smiths."; // Won't work
?>
Result


The negative numeric indices are supported.

Copy
<?php
$string = 'string';
echo "The character at index -2 is $string[-2].", PHP_EOL;
$string[-3] = 'o';
echo "Changing the character at index -3 to o gives $string.", PHP_EOL;
?>
