The switch statement executes statement by statement.

In the beginning, no code is executed.

Only when a case statement is found whose expression evaluates to a value that matches the value of the switch expression does PHP begin to execute the statements.

PHP continues to execute the statements until the end of the switch block, or the first time it sees a break statement.

If you don't write a break statement at the end of a case's statement list, PHP will go on executing the statements of the following case.

For example:

Copy
<?php
$i = 1;
switch ($i) {
    case 0:
        echo "i equals 0";
    case 1:
        echo "i equals 1";
    case 2:
        echo "i equals 2";
}
?>
Result


Here, if $i is equal to 0, PHP would execute all of the echo statements! If $i is equal to 1, PHP would execute the last two echo statements.

You would get the expected behavior ('i equals 2' would be displayed) only if $i is equal to 2.

Thus, it is important not to forget break statements.

In a switch statement, the condition is evaluated only once and the result is compared to each case statement.

In an elseif statement, the condition is evaluated again.

The statement list for a case can also be empty, which simply passes control into the statement list for the next case.

Copy
<?php
$i = 1;
switch ($i) {
    case 0:
    case 1:
    case 2:
        echo "i is less than 3 but not negative";
        break;
    case 3:
        echo "i is 3";
}
?>
