The switch statement is similar to a series of if statements on the same expression.

Unlike some other languages, the continue statement applies to switch and acts similar to break.

If you have a switch inside a loop and wish to continue to the next iteration of the outer loop, use continue 2.

Note that switch/case does loose comparison.

The following two examples are two different ways to write the same thing, one using a series of if and elseif statements, and the other using the switch statement:

switch structure

Copy
<?php
$i = 0;
if ($i == 0) {
    echo "i equals 0";
} elseif ($i == 1) {
    echo "i equals 1";
} elseif ($i == 2) {
    echo "i equals 2";
}

switch ($i) {
    case 0:
        echo "i equals 0";
        break;
    case 1:
        echo "i equals 1";
        break;
    case 2:
        echo "i equals 2";
        break;
}
?>
Result


switch structure allows usage of strings

Copy
<?php
$i = 0;
switch ($i) {
    case "apple":
        echo "i is apple";
        break;
    case "bar":
        echo "i is bar";
        break;
    case "cake":
        echo "i is cake";
        break;
}
?>
