PHP offers an alternative syntax for some of its control structures:

if,
while,
for,
foreach, and
switch.
In each case, the basic form of the alternate syntax is to change the opening brace to a colon (:) and the closing brace to endif;, endwhile;, endfor;, endforeach;, or endswitch;, respectively.

Copy
<?php if ($a == 5): ?>
A is equal to 5
<?php endif; ?>


In the above example, the HTML block "A is equal to 5" is nested within an if statement written in the alternative syntax.

The HTML block would be displayed only if $a is equal to 5.

The alternative syntax applies to else and elseif as well.

The following is an if structure with elseif and else in the alternative format:

Copy
<?php
if ($a == 5):
    echo "a equals 5";
    echo "...";
elseif ($a == 6):
    echo "a equals 6";
    echo "!!!";
else:
    echo "a is neither 5 nor 6";
endif;
?>



Mixing syntaxes in the same control block is not supported.

Any output between a switch statement and the first case will result in a syntax error.

For example, this is invalid:

Copy
<?php switch ($foo): ?>
    <?php case 1: ?>
    ...
<?php endswitch ?>
Whereas the following is valid, as the trailing newline after the switch statement is considered part of the closing ?> and hence nothing is output between the switch and case:

Copy
<?php switch ($foo): ?>
<?php case 1: ?>
    ...
<?php endswitch ?>
