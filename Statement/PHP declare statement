The declare statement is used to set execution directives for a block of code.

The syntax of declare is similar to the syntax of other flow control constructs:

Copy
declare (directive)
    statement
Result


Three directives are recognized:

the ticks directive,
the encoding directive and
the strict_types directive
As directives are handled as the file is being compiled, only literals may be given as directive values.

Variables and constants cannot be used. To illustrate:

Copy
<?php
// This is valid:
declare(ticks=1);

// This is invalid:
const TICK_VALUE = 1;
declare(ticks=TICK_VALUE);
?>
The declare construct can also be used in the global scope, affecting all code following it.

If the file with declare was included then it does not affect the parent file.

Copy
<?php
// these are the same:

// you can use this:
declare(ticks=1) {
    // entire script here
}

// or you can use this:
declare(ticks=1);
// entire script here
?>
