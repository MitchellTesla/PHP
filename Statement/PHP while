while loops are the simplest type of loop in PHP.

The basic form of a while statement is:

Copy
while (expr)
    statement
A while statement tells PHP to execute the nested statement(s) repeatedly, as long as the while expression evaluates to true. The value of the expression is checked each time at the beginning of the loop.

If the while expression evaluates to false from the very beginning, the nested statement(s) won't even be run once.

Like with the if statement, you can group multiple statements within the same while loop by surrounding a group of statements with curly braces, or by using the alternate syntax:

Copy
while (expr):
    statement
    ...
endwhile;
The following examples are identical, and both print the numbers 1 through 10:

Copy
<?php
/* example 1 */
$i = 1;
while ($i <= 10) {
    echo $i++;  
    /* the printed value would be $i before the increment (post-increment) */
}
/* example 2 */
$i = 1;
while ($i <= 10):
    echo $i;
    $i++;
endwhile;
?>
