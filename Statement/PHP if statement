PHP if statement allows for conditional execution of code fragments.

Copy
if (expr)
  statement
If expression evaluates to true, PHP will execute statement, and if it evaluates to false - it'll ignore it.

The following example would display a is bigger than b if $a is bigger than $b:

Copy
<?php
if ($a > $b)
    echo "a is bigger than b";
?>
To have more than one statement to be executed conditionally, group several statements into a statement group.

For example, this code would display a is bigger than b if $a is bigger than $b, and would then assign the value of $a into $b:

Copy
<?php
if ($a > $b) {
  echo "a is bigger than b";
  $b = $a;
}
?>
If statements can be nested infinitely within other if statements, which provides you with complete flexibility for conditional execution of the various parts of your program.

else
else extends an if statement to execute a statement in case the expression in the if statement evaluates to false.

For example, the following code would display a is greater than b if $a is greater than $b, and a is NOT greater than b otherwise:

Copy
<?php
if ($a > $b) {
  echo "a is greater than b";
} else {
  echo "a is NOT greater than b";
}
?>
elseif/else if
elseif is a combination of if and else.

Like else, it extends an if statement to execute a different statement in case the original if expression evaluates to false.

It will execute that alternative expression only if the elseif conditional expression evaluates to true.

For example, the following code would display a is bigger than b, a equal to b or a is smaller than b:

Copy
<?php
if ($a > $b) {
    echo "a is bigger than b";
} elseif ($a == $b) {
    echo "a is equal to b";
} else {
    echo "a is smaller than b";
}
?>
There may be several elseif statements within the same if statement.

When using a colon to define your if/elseif conditions, you must not separate else if into two words, or PHP will fail with a parse error.

Copy
<?php
/* Incorrect Method: */
if ($a > $b):
    echo $a." is greater than ".$b;
else if ($a == $b): // Will not compile.
    echo "The above line causes a parse error.";
endif;


/* Correct Method: */
if ($a > $b):
    echo $a." is greater than ".$b;
elseif ($a == $b): // Note the combination of the words.
    echo $a." equals ".$b;
else:
    echo $a." is neither greater than or equal to ".$b;
endif;

?>
