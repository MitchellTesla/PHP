The include expression includes and evaluates the specified file.

The explanation below also applies to require.

Path
Files are included based on the file path given or the include_path specified.

If the file isn't found in the include_path, include will check in the calling script's own directory and the current working directory.

The include construct will emit an E_WARNING if it cannot find a file; this is different behavior from require, which will emit an E_ERROR.

If a path is defined in the include, the include_path will be ignored altogether.

For example, if a filename begins with ../, the parser will look in the parent directory to find the requested file.

Scope
When a file is included, the code it contains inherits the variable scope of the line on which the include occurs.

Any variables available at that line in the calling file will be available within the called file, from that point forward.

However, all functions and classes defined in the included file have the global scope.

Basic include example

vars.php

Copy
<?php

$color = 'green';
$fruit = 'apple';

?>
test.php

Copy
<?php
echo "A $color $fruit"; // A

include 'vars.php';

echo "A $color $fruit"; // A green apple

?>


If the include occurs inside a function, then all of the code contained in the called file will behave as though it had been defined inside that function.

So, it will follow the variable scope of that function.

An exception to this rule are magic constants which are evaluated by the parser before the include occurs.

Including within functions

Copy
<?php

function foo()
{
    global $color;

    include 'vars.php';

    echo "A $color $fruit";
}

/* vars.php is in the scope of foo() so     *
* $fruit is NOT available outside of this  *
* scope.  $color is because we declared it *
* as global.                               */

foo();                    // A green apple
echo "A $color $fruit";   // A green

?>


Any code inside the target file which should be executed as PHP code must be enclosed within valid PHP start and end tags.
