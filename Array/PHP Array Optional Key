The key is optional.

If it is not specified, PHP will use the increment of the largest previously used int key.

Indexed arrays without key

Copy
<?php
$array = array("foo", "bar", "hello", "world");
var_dump($array);
?>



It is possible to specify the key only for some elements and leave it out for others:

Keys not on all elements

Copy
<?php
$array = array(
         "a",
         "b",
    6 => "c",
         "d",
);
var_dump($array);
?>



As you can see the last value "d" was assigned the key 7.

This is because the largest integer key before that was 6
