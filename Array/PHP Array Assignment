Array assignment always involves value copying.

Use the reference operator to copy an array by reference.

Copy
<?php
$arr1 = array(2, 3);
print_r($arr1);

$arr2 = $arr1;
print_r($arr2);

$arr2[] = 4; // $arr2 is changed,
             // $arr1 is still array(2, 3)

$arr3 = &$arr1;
print_r($arr3);
$arr3[] = 4; // now $arr1 and $arr3 are the same
print_r($arr1);
print_r($arr3);
?>
