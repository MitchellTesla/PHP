When PHP parses a file, it looks for opening and closing tags, which are <?php and ?>

Those two tags tell PHP to start and stop interpreting the code between them.

Parsing in this manner allows PHP to be embedded in all sorts of different documents, as everything outside of a pair of opening and closing tags is ignored by the PHP parser.


Short hand
PHP includes a short echo tag <?= which is a short-hand to the more verbose <?php echo.

You can use the short echo tag to <?= 'print this string' ?>.

It's equivalent to <?php echo 'print this string' ?>.

Short tags are available by default but can be disabled either via the short_open_tag php.ini configuration file directive, or are disabled by default if PHP is built with the --disable-short-tags configuration.

As short tags can be disabled it is recommended to only use the normal tags (<?php ?> and <?= ?>) to maximise compatibility.



If a file contains only PHP code, it is preferable to omit the PHP closing tag at the end of the file.

Copy
<?php
echo "Hello world";

// ... more code

echo "Last statement";

// the script ends here with no PHP closing tag
