PHP requires statements to be terminated with a semicolon at the end of each statement.

The closing tag of a block of PHP code automatically implies a semicolon; you do not need to have a semicolon terminating the last line of a PHP block.

The closing tag for the block will include the immediately trailing newline if one is present.

Example showing the closing tag encompassing the trailing newline

Copy
<?php echo "Some text"; ?>
No newline
<?= "But newline now" ?>
The above example will output:

Output:


Examples of entering and exiting the PHP parser:

Copy
<?php
    echo 'This is a test';
?>

<?php echo 'This is a test' ?>

<?php echo 'We omitted the last closing tag';
Result


The closing tag of a PHP block at the end of a file is optional.

In some cases omitting it is helpful when using include or require, so unwanted whitespace will not occur at the end of files, and you will still be able to add headers to the response later.

It is also handy if you use output buffering, and would not like to see added unwanted whitespace at the end of the parts generated by the included files.
