Create a file named hello.php and put it in your web server's root directory (DOCUMENT_ROOT) with the following content:

Copy
<html>
 <head>
  <title>PHP Test</title>
 </head>
 <body>
 <?php echo '<p>Hello World</p>'; ?> 
 </body>
</html>


Use your browser to access the file with your web server's URL, ending with the /hello.php file reference.

When developing locally this URL will be something like http://localhost/hello.php or http://127.0.0.1/hello.php but this depends on the web server's configuration.

If everything is configured correctly, this file will be parsed by PHP and the following output will be sent to your browser:

Copy
<html>
 <head>
  <title>PHP Test</title>
 </head>
 <body>
 <p>Hello World</p>
 </body>
</html>



This program displays: Hello World using the PHP echo statement.

Get system information from PHP

Copy
<?php phpinfo(); ?>



Check what sort of browser the visitor is using.

We check the user agent string the browser sends as part of the HTTP request.

This information is stored in a variable.

Variables always start with a dollar-sign in PHP.

The variable we are interested in right now is $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'].

$_SERVER is a special reserved PHP variable that contains all web server information.

It is known as a super global.



To display this variable, you can simply do:


<?php
echo $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
?>

A sample output of this script may be:

Copy
Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)


Getting PHP to run from the command line can be performed.

Copy
C:\PHP5\php.exe -f "C:\PHP Scripts\script.php" -- -arg1 -arg2 -arg3
