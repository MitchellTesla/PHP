The scope of a variable is the context within which it is defined.

For the most part all PHP variables only have a single scope.

This single scope spans included and required files as well.

For example:

Copy
<?php
$a = 1;
include 'b.inc';
?>
Here the $a variable will be available within the included b.inc script.

Within user-defined functions a local function scope is introduced. Any variable used inside a function is by default limited to the local function scope.

For example:

Copy
<?php
$a = 1; /* global scope */
function test()
{
    echo $a; /* reference to local scope variable */
}
test();
?>
This script will not produce any output because the echo statement refers to a local version of the $a variable, and it has not been assigned a value within this scope.
