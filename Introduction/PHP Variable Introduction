Variables in PHP are represented by a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable.

The variable name is case-sensitive.

Naming
Variable names follow the same rules as other labels in PHP.

A valid variable name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores.

A letter is a-z, A-Z.

$this is a special variable that can't be assigned.

Copy
<?php
$var = 'Bob';
$Var = 'Joe';
echo "$var, $Var";      // outputs "Bob, Joe"
$4site = 'test';     // invalid; starts with a number
$_4site = 'test';    // valid; starts with an underscore
?>
