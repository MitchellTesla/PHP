What is PHP?
PHP stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".

It is a widely-used Open Source general-purpose scripting language.

It is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.

Its syntax draws upon C, Java, and Perl, and is easy to learn.

The PHP language allows web developers to write dynamically generated web pages quickly.

Copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Example</title>
    </head>
    <body>

        <?php
            echo "Hi, I'm a PHP script!";
        ?>

    </body>
</html>




Instead of outputting HTML, PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code that does the job.

In this case, output "Hi, I'm a PHP script!".

The PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions <?php and ?> that allow you to jump into and out of "PHP mode."

PHP code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client.

The client would receive the results of running that script, but would not know what the underlying code was.
