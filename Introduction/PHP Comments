PHP supports 'C', 'C++' and Unix shell-style (Perl style) comments.

For example:

Copy
<?php
    echo 'This is a test'; // This is a one-line c++ style comment
    /* This is a multi line comment
       yet another line of comment */
    echo 'This is yet another test';
    echo 'One Final Test'; # This is a one-line shell-style comment
?>
Result


The "one-line" comment styles only comment to the end of the line or the current block of PHP code, whichever comes first.

This means that HTML code after // ... ?> or # ... ?> WILL be printed: ?> breaks out of PHP mode and returns to HTML mode, and // or # cannot influence that.

Copy
<h1>This is an <?php # echo 'simple';?> example</h1>
<p>The header above will say 'This is an  example'.</p>
Result


'C' style comments end at the first */ encountered.

Make sure you don't nest 'C' style comments.

It is easy to make this mistake if you are trying to comment out a large block of code.

Copy
<?php
 /*
    echo 'This is a test'; /* This comment will cause a problem */
 */
?>
