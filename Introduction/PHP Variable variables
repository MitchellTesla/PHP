The variable variable name is a variable name which can be set and used dynamically.

A normal variable is set with a statement such as:

Copy
<?php
$a = 'hello';
?>
A variable variable takes the value of a variable and treats that as the name of a variable.

In the above example, hello, can be used as the name of a variable by using two dollar signs. i.e.

Copy
<?php
$$a = 'world';
?>
At this point two variables have been defined and stored in the PHP symbol tree: $a with contents "hello" and $hello with contents "world".

Therefore, this statement:

Copy
<?php
echo "$a ${$a}";
?>
produces the exact same output as:

Copy
<?php
echo "$a $hello";
?>
i.e. they both produce: hello world.

Please note that variable variables cannot be used with PHP's Superglobal arrays within functions or class methods.

The variable $this is also a special variable that cannot be referenced dynamically.
