Everything outside of a pair of opening and closing tags is ignored by the PHP parser which allows PHP files to have mixed content.

This allows PHP to be embedded in HTML documents, for example to create templates.

Copy

<?php echo 'While this is going to be parsed.'; ?>
<p>This will also be ignored by PHP and displayed by the browser.</p>
