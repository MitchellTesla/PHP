Copy
<input type="image" src="image.gif" name="sub" />


When the user clicks somewhere on the image, the accompanying form will be transmitted to the server with two additional variables, sub_x and sub_y.

These contain the coordinates of the user click within the image.

The experienced may note that the actual variable names sent by the browser contains a period rather than an underscore, but PHP converts the period to an underscore automatically.
